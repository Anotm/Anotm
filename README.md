- 👋 Hi, I’m @Anotm, I am in Carleton university studying Software engineering. I have finished 3 years in 
          Mechanical engineering, but since my passion has always been in computers, I decided to switch 
          my program. 
          
- 👀 I’m interested in designing tools and applications that I can use in my daily life whether its for games, 
          school, work, or fun projects. I love throwing myself into a project and learning as I go, 
          uncovering new and cool ways to simplify tasks and automate them.
          
- 🌱 I learned basic C++ in high school. From there I wanted to learn Python which resulted in me writing many 
          programs as a hands-on way to learn.
          
- 💞️ Hopefully I’ll be able to soon collaborate with other ambitious coders to create fascinating applications. 
          I’m opened to meeting new people and chatting about ideas and methods to better my code or provide 
          any help I can give.
